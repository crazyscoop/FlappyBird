# FlappyBird

Happy Bird is a 2D side-scroller platform video game for Microsoft Windows.This project is based on the legendary Flappy Bird game launched in 2013 which went viral almost instantaneously. The specialty of the game was its simplicity and addictive nature. I have tried to recreate the game with as much resemblance as possible as I wanted to create an exact clone of the game for laptops and PCs. 

## Gameplay
The objective of the game is to control a flying bird, which moves continuously to the right, between sets of Mario-like pipes. If the player touches the pipes, they lose. The bird briefly flaps upward each time that the player presses spacebar or mouse left button. Each pair of pipes that he navigates between earns the player a single point, with medals awarded for the score at the end of the game.
